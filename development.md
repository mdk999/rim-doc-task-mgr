### Development (How we're going to build)

---

- We'll need a Repository to hold the code as it's being developed i.e. GitHub
- Issue tracking i.e. GitHub, Jira
- Wireframes/Mockups from designers
- Local development setup (preferably containerized solution)
- IDE to develop in i.e. Visual Studio Code
- Unit tests to be written to validate functionality
- Database Migrations
- Controllers for each Entity
- Models for each Entity
- Service classes for reusable functionality
- Reusable components for UI
- UI Framework for consistent layout
- Remote server to deploy our code to for QA/Testing purposes
- CI/CD Pipeline to move code from Repository to Server i.e. GitHub Actions
- Load testing possibly as well i.e. JMeter
