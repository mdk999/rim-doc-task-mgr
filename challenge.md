### The product team has identified the next priority to obtain some more detailed technical specs on.

---

##### The business problem/roadmap item is the need for a document and task manager. The following is what we know so far:
- The system shall allow a user to add documents
- The system shall version documents
- The system shall allow a user to add tasks to a document
- The system shall allow a user to download a document

##### Considerations:
- UI currently with design
- Product started user stories but needs to ensure technical solution before continuing
- Solution needs to consider how integrations with clients document management system will be affected/ handled.
- This roadmap item is critical to a new client launch, which is expected to be completed by the end of January.

##### Existing technology/infrastructure stack/skill of developers:
- BE API (PHP / Laravel)
- FE (Nuxt / Vue.js)
- DB (MYSQL, REDIS)
- CLOUD (AWS, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD (Github actions / ArgoCD)

Please document what questions you have, assumptions you would make when coding, technical dependencies and draft a handful of technical stories. Along with the stories, provide a magnitude of effort so we can understand what we can do as a minimum for the February release. And lastly, a diagram if applicable to assist in explaining the above.
